****
**My take** on this project was to practice what I've learned but mostly to Explore new areas and challenges.  
A great portion of the efforts went into setting goals, questioning methods,researching for best practice ,scrapping and re-writing.  

**The concept** is to offer the user a destination based on how far she, he or they would like to travel. once the user passes the departure location the app will present all possible destinations on an interactive Bar chart.
